--> This is the README file.
--> It contains some basic information about the project.

--> Project Title: "Brain Tumor Segmentation using Deep Neural Networks"
 
--> Project Description :
    --> This project is about Brain Tumor Segmentation. 
    --> It has been done in two phases: phase1 and phase2
    --> In phase1, we have built a simple cnn model based on baseline u-net architecture.
    --> In phase2, we have implemented attention U-Net architecture to improve baseline predictions.
    
    
--> Individual Contribution:
    This project is being done by a team of two members:
    	1. Dhruv Saini(12140590):
    	   --> Did data pre-processing
    	   --> Made the data processed in such a way that it can be feed to our model
    	   --> Did Models Comparision and analysis
    	   --> Explored various research papers 
    	  
    	  
    	2. Mitul Vardhan(12141070):
    	   --> Implemented the baseline U-Net architecture for CNN model
    	   --> Implemented attention U-Net architecture
    	   --> Model training and analysis
