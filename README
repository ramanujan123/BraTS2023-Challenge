--> This is the README file.
--> It contains some basic information about the project.

--> Project Title: "Brain Tumor Segmentation using Deep Neural Networks"
 
--> Project Description :
    --> This project is about Brain Tumor Segmentation. 
    --> It has been done in two phases: phase1 and phase2
    --> In phase1, a simple cnn model based on baseline u-net architecture was built.
    --> In phase2, attention mechanism was addded to the U-Net architecture to improve baseline predictions.
    --> Saliency maps were used to show segmentation results
